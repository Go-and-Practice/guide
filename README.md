# The Student's Guide to @lintool

I started as an assistant professor in 2004.
Over the years, I've become increasingly convinced that the graduate school experience is most like an apprenticeship, where graduate students learn to "do research" by working with their advisors.
This [intensively personal](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1296) relationship is difficult to scale, but I've discovered that I give the same advice over and over again.
So, it makes sense to write things down.
This repo is the result of those efforts.
Every time I say something to a student that I've repeated before, I write it down here.

The result is a student's guide to @lintool.

Of course, every advisor is idiosyncratic (putting it mildly), and I only claim that this advice is what I give to _my_ students.
I generally agree with Oded Goldreich in there being [no generic advice](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/advice.html).
There are definitely many ways to succeed, but there are no doubt "archetypes", but every graduate student starts off with his or her advisor as a reference point.
As a result, I suspect that at least some of what I say to my students are said by other advisors to their students.
A few may even rise to the level of "research best practices".
Given the potential relevance to others, I'm publicly sharing these documents.
Of course, YMMV, and take everything with the usual grain of [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride).

+ [Writing a Research Paper With Me](writing-a-research-paper-with-me.md): this describes specifically how I work with my students, but may contain general advice on writing research papers that are broadly applicable.
+ [Writing Pet Peeves](writing-pet-peeves.md): If you want to stay on my good side.

## Other Odds and Ends
