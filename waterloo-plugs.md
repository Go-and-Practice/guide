# Waterloo Plugs

Every time I come across a media mention of the burgeoning tech scene in Waterloo, the GTA ([Greater Toronto Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area)), or Canada in general, I make note of it here.

I'll admit, some of these reports are a bit "flaky" and hype-ish... so take with a big grain of [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt).

> I also spoke with Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, one of the best-known providers of first-step seed money for tech start-ups. I asked him if any one school stood out in terms of students and graduates whose ideas took off. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he responded, and I was sure of the name I‚Äôd hear next: Stanford. It‚Äôs his alma mater, though he left before he graduated, and it‚Äôs famous as a feeder of Silicon Valley success.
>
> But this is what he said: ‚ÄúThe University of Waterloo.‚Äù It‚Äôs a public school in the Canadian province of Ontario, and as of last summer, it was the source of eight proud ventures that Y Combinator had helped along. ‚ÄúTo my chagrin,‚Äù Altman told me, ‚ÄúStanford has not had a really great track record.‚Äù
