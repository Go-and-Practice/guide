# Coding Style

These are general coding style guidelines we've adopted for my research group.

## General

+ We use a maximum line length of 120 character.
The rationale for this limit is that 120 is (approximately) the number of characters that will render in GitHub without horizontal scrolling.
This maximizes use of screen real estate.

## Python

+ We adopt [PEP8](https://pep8.org/).
+ We adopt single quotes `'`' for strings; unless another approach is obviously better, we use [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) for formatting.
+ We adopt the [numpy docstring style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).

## Java

+ Two space indent, otherwise standard conventions.
