# What working with me is like

+ Unlike most advisors, I don't have regular, fixed meetings with students.
The rationale is that progress doesn't happen at an even pace.
Sometimes you're churning out experimental results every two days and need my help interpreting them&mdash;making you wait until your next weekly meeting makes no sense.
Sometimes you're in the middle of a complex implementation that may take a couple of weeks&mdash;you'll have nothing to tell me other than "I'm working on it".

+ Instead, I try to keep as much of my schedule free as possible and give you individualized attention.
I might spend an entire afternoon brainstorming an idea with you, but then not meet again for three weeks while you're implementing the idea.
Toward the end of your Ph.D. career, I might say, "Go write your thesis!" and not meet with you for a month until I see drafts. 

+ TODO: Write about Slack. Slack fills in the little crevices in time.
