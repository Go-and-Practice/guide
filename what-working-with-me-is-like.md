# What working with me is like

+ Unlike most advisors, I don't have regular, fixed meetings with students.
The rationale is that progress doesn't happen at an even pace.
Sometimes you're churning out experimental results every two days and need my help interpreting them&mdash;making you wait until our next weekly meeting makes no sense to me.
Sometimes you're in the middle of a complex implementation that may take a couple of weeks&mdash;you'll have nothing to tell me other than "I'm working on it".

+ Instead, I try to keep as much of my schedule free as possible and give you individualized attention.
I might spend an entire afternoon brainstorming an idea with you, but then not meet again for three weeks while you're implementing the idea.
Toward the end of your Ph.D. career, I might say, "Go write your thesis!" and not meet with you for a month until I see drafts.

+ I am a heavy Slack user and use it as my primary channel of communication with students.
My favorite thing about Slack is that it fills in the "little crevices in time" that allows me to effectively multitask.
For example, when I'm waiting in line at the checkout, I can use the 30 seconds productively on a quick issue.

+ I don't particularly care _where_ you work, as long as you're productive.

+ I don't particularly care _when_ you work, as long as you're productive.
Want to work on Hawaii time (which is six hours behind Waterloo)? Fine with me.
