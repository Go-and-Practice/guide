# What working with me is like

+ Unlike most advisors, I don't have regular, fixed meetings with students.
The rationale is that progress doesn't happen at an even pace.
Sometimes you're churning out experimental results every two days and need my help interpreting them&mdash;making you wait until your next weekly meeting makes no sense.
Sometimes you're in the middle of a complex implementation that may take a couple of weeks&mdash;you'll have nothing to tell me other than "I'm working on it".

+ Instead, I try to keep as much of my schedule free as possible and give you individualized attention.
I might spend an entire afternoon brainstorming an idea with you, but then not meet again for three weeks while you're implementing the idea.
Toward the end of your Ph.D. career, I might say, "Go write your thesis!" and not meet with you for a month until I see drafts. 

+ TODO: Write about Slack. Slack fills in the little crevices in time.

## What my personal schedule is like

+ Each weekday, I typically wake up around 7am.
I help get my kids ready for school, which starts at 9:10am.
In between, I can usually squeeze in quick emails or Slack conversations, but typically not anything that requires concentration, like writing papers.

+ If I'm in lab that day, I'll arrive around 9:30am.

+ I typically leave lab no later than around 4:30pm-ish to pick up kids from school.

+ From when I pick up kids to when the kids go to bed (8:30pm to 9pm-ish) is family time.
I might squeeze in light email and Slack conversations, e.g., when I'm sitting in the bleachers watching the kids' swim lessons, but I don't do anything that requires concentration.
Unless absolutely necessary, I also refuse synchronous calls of any type (this is consequential for collaborators on the US west coast, because it basically means that I can't do anything after 2pm-ish west coast time).

+ I'm fully engaged with work again after the kids go to bed, starting around 9pm-ish.
If you'd like to have a synchronous conference call, this time works for me.
I typically work for a bit, depending on the urgency of various deadlines.
For example, if there are paper deadlines, I might put in another two solid hours of writing.
If there's nothing particularly urgent, I might do a bit of email and then call it a night.
I'll unwind a bit, and I usually go to bed around 11pm-ish.

+ **I try to get 7&#8211;8 hours of sleep every night.** Closer to the 8 hour mark, actually.

+ Family gets priority on weekends.
I'll usually engage in email and Slack conversations.
I'll work when it doesn't interfere with family&mdash;for example, if kids are at an activity or are napping.
Typically, I estimate that I can squeeze in five hours of solid, concentrated work.

+ I estimate that I work around 40&#8211;50 hours a week.
This doesn't include the little crevices in time when I am able to multitask effectively.
For example, I don't know how to count the time I'm slacking with a student while watching my kids' skating lessons.

+ I break up my time into [maker's schedule, manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).
