# Thesis Tips

+ **Be more discursive.**
Interestingly, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discursive) defines discursive as either (1) rambling or (2) proceeding coherently from topic to topic, an interesting case of a word in English [also meaning its exact opposite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-antonym).
But I'm being discursive (in the first sense).
I often find that students are too _terse_ in writing their theses.
I think this stems from the fact that they've been buried in a problem for months (or even years in the case of a Ph.D.) &mdash; many aspects of the problem are "obvious".
But this isn't the case for the reader, who may be encountering the problem for the first time.
In my experience, this happens most frequently in the introduction, when explaining the setup of the problem, what the research is trying to accomplish, etc.
Remember, theses don't have page limits!
Walk the reader through your arguments; explicitly spell things out.
