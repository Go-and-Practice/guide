# What my personal schedule is like

+ Each weekday, I typically wake up around 7am.
I help get my kids ready for school, which starts at 9:10am.
In between, I can usually squeeze in quick emails or Slack conversations, but typically not anything that requires concentration, like writing papers.

+ If I'm in lab that day, I'll arrive around 9:30am.

+ I typically leave lab no later than around 4:30pm-ish to pick up kids from school.

+ From when I pick up kids to when the kids go to bed (8:30pm to 9pm-ish) is family time.
I might squeeze in light email and Slack conversations, e.g., when I'm sitting in the bleachers watching the kids' swim lessons, but I don't do anything that requires concentration.
Unless absolutely necessary, I also refuse synchronous calls of any type (this is consequential for collaborators on the US west coast, because it basically means that I can't do anything after 2pm-ish west coast time).

+ I'm fully engaged with work again after the kids go to bed, starting around 9pm-ish.
If you'd like to have a synchronous conference call, this time works for me.
I typically work for a bit, depending on the urgency of various deadlines.
For example, if there are paper deadlines, I might put in another two solid hours of writing.
If there's nothing particularly urgent, I might do a bit of email and then call it a night.
I'll unwind a bit, and I usually go to bed around 11pm-ish.

+ **I try to get 7&#8211;8 hours of sleep every night.** Closer to the 8 hour mark, actually.

+ Family gets priority on weekends.
I'll usually engage in email and Slack conversations.
I'll work when it doesn't interfere with family&mdash;for example, if kids are at an activity or are napping.
Typically, I estimate that I can squeeze in five hours of solid, concentrated work.

+ I estimate that I work around 40&#8211;50 hours a week.
This doesn't include the little crevices in time when I am able to multitask effectively.
For example, I don't know how to count the time I'm slacking with a student while watching my kids' skating lessons.

+ I break up my time into [maker's schedule, manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).
If you don't know what that means, go read Paul Graham's blog post.
